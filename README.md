The code includes various steps to be followed for the clustering on any Dataset: <br>
1.Scaling the data<br>
2.Measuring VAT to see the clustering tendencies<br>
3.Applying Hopkins method <br>
4.Finding the optimal number of clusters<br>
5.Finding Average SSE and Silhoute Scores of clusters<br>
6.Finding which Clustering algorithm works best for the dataset<br>
